# @ydbjs/topic — state machine maps

Contributor documentation. The reader and writer are each built from two finite state
machines on top of `@ydbjs/fsm`, plus a thin public facade. This file is the map of
every machine: states, transitions, timers, and the invariants the design rests on.

The transition tables below mirror the exhaustive `switch` dispatch in the `*-state.ts`
files one-to-one — every `(state, event)` pair is either a table row or falls into the
`(everything else)` row. **When you change a dispatch, update the matching table and
diagram in the same commit.**

## The two-FSM pipeline

```mermaid

    subgraph facade [Facade — writer.ts / reader.ts]
        API[public API<br/>write/flush/close · read/commit/close]
    end
    subgraph domain [Domain FSM — writer-state.ts / reader-state.ts]
        D[pure transition<br/>ctx mutations, effects, outputs]
    end
    subgraph transport [Transport FSM — transport-state.ts]
        T[one gRPC stream lifecycle<br/>classify server frames]
    end
    G[(gRPC StreamWrite /<br/>StreamRead)]

    API -- events --> D
    D -- outputs (AsyncQueue) --> API
    D -- effects --> R[runtime<br/>writer-runtime.ts / reader-runtime.ts]
    R -- events --> D
    R -- connect/send --> T
    T -- outputs --> R
    T <--> G
```

- The **domain FSM** is pure and synchronous: it mutates `ctx` in place and returns the
  next state plus a list of effects. All I/O lives in the **runtime**, which executes
  effects (connect, send, timers) and feeds results back as events.
- The **transport FSM** owns exactly one physical stream at a time: it classifies raw
  server frames into typed facts and reports stream life/death. Reconnect policy lives
  in the domain FSM, never in the transport.
- Outputs flow to the facade through an `AsyncQueue` with drain-then-throw semantics:
  on a fatal error the queue delivers already-emitted facts (acks, commit confirmations)
  first, then throws the reason.
- Convention: the domain FSMs log deliberately-ignored `(state, event)` pairs via
  `ignored()`; the transport FSMs drop unhandled events silently — they are pure
  classifiers, and every meaningful fact already has an explicit case.

## Writer FSM (`writer-state.ts`)

- `idle` — created, not started; accepts writes into the buffer before connecting
- `connecting` — one stream attempt in flight, `start_timeout` watchdog armed
- `ready` — live session; pumps buffer → inflight, handles acks/token
- `reconnecting` — backing off between attempts (`retry_backoff` armed; `recovery_window` armed only if `recoveryWindowMs` is finite)
- `closing` — graceful drain gate, bounded by `graceful_timeout`; keeps reconnecting to finish the drain
- `closed` — graceful/destroyed terminal (final)
- `errored` — fatal terminal (final)

    note right of closed
        writer.destroy from any non-terminal state lands here.
        writer.close with an already-empty window skips closing
        and terminates directly in closed.
    end note
```

Helper resolution: `toReady` → `ready`; `toReconnecting` → `reconnecting`; `toClosing` →
`closing` (or straight to `closed` via `closeWhenDrained` if the window is already
empty); `terminate(s)` → `s` with `final:{reason}`, emits `writer.closed` (plus
`writer.error` when `errored`), frees the message window, effects `[transport.close,
finalize]`. `pump` keeps the state — effect `send.write_request(batch)` when sendable,
self-dispatches `writer.pump` while more can be sent. `connectEffects` =
`[transport.connect(getLastSeqNo=!hasEverConnected), schedule start_timeout]`.

Retryable classification (`isRetryableWriterError`): a clean end (no error) is
retryable; payload-too-large (`ClientError RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` + `/larger than/i`) is
always fatal; `SCHEME_ERROR` is retryable only with `retryOnSchemeError`; otherwise
`isRetryableStreamError || isRetryableError(err, idempotent=true)` — writes are
idempotent (producerId+seqNo dedup), so the conditionally-retryable YDB statuses retry.

## Writer transport FSM (`writer/transport-state.ts`)

- `idle` — created, no stream yet
- `connecting` — `open_stream` issued, awaiting init (one physical streamWrite lifecycle)
- `ready` — init seen; forwarding classified stream facts as outputs
- `disconnected` — stream ended/errored; awaiting `transport.connect` (reopen) or `transport.close`
- `closed` — terminal (final)

## Reader FSM (`reader-state.ts`)

- `idle` — initial; only `reader.start` / `reader.close` are meaningful
- `connecting` — stream being opened; `start_timeout` armed
- `ready` — live stream. No seqNo recovery (unlike the writer) — the server re-sends `start_partition` per partition, and commit reconcile happens there
- `reconnecting` — backoff between attempts; `retry_backoff` armed, `recovery_window` only when finite
- `closing` — `close()` drain of pending work (pending commits / stopping-graceful partitions), bounded by `graceful_timeout`
- `closed` — terminal (clean close or destroy)
- `errored` — terminal (non-retryable stream error or recovery-window expiry)

Per-partition entry lifecycle (inside `ctx.partitions`, keyed by the **stable**
`partitionKey(topicPath, partitionId)` — partition ids alone collide across the
topics of a multi-topic reader; the ephemeral `partitionSessionId → partitionKey`
mapping lives in `ctx.sessionIndex` and is cleared on every reconnect):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> active: stream.start_partition (grantId++, ackPending)
    active --> active: partition.start_ready → send start_response,\nre-send buffered commits (ackPending=false)
    active --> stopping_graceful: stop_partition [graceful] (stop hook + timer;\nstill delivers and commits)
    active --> stopped: stop_partition [force]
    stopping_graceful --> stopped: partition.stop_ready [drained] → send stop_response
    stopping_graceful --> stopped: commit_response [drained ∧ stopReady] → send stop_response
    stopping_graceful --> stopped: timer.partition_graceful_timeout (force)
    stopping_graceful --> stopped: stop_partition [force] (escalation)
    active --> ended: stream.end_partition (kept for commit reconcile;\nchild/adjacent ids on the session)
    stopped --> active: stream.start_partition (re-grant; pendings narrowed)
    ended --> active: stream.start_partition
    stopped --> [*]: timer.partition_reassign_gc\n(reject pending commits, delete entry)
```

The graceful stop is the protocol's soft-stop window: the entry keeps delivering
buffered data and accepting commits while the async `onPartitionSessionStop` hook
runs (effect `partition.stop_hook` → event `partition.stop_ready`, guarded by
`grantId` like the start handshake); the stop response goes out only once the hook
completed AND the pending commits drained — bounded by the per-partition timeout.

Helper resolution: `terminate(s, reason)` → `s` with `final:{reason}`; emits
`reader.error` (when `errored`), `reader.commit.rejected` for every pending commit,
`reader.closed`; clears ctx; effects `transport.close`, clear all timers, `finalize`.
`toReady` → `ready`: `attempts=0`, clear `sessionIndex`, reset flow-control; emits
`reader.session`; schedules `update_token`, sends `read_request(maxBufferBytes)`, and
arms `partition_reassign_gc:key` for every partition holding pending commits.
`toReconnecting(err)` → `reconnecting`: clear `sessionIndex`; emits
`reader.reconnecting`; schedules `retry_backoff` (+`recovery_window` iff finite).
`toClosing` → `closing` iff pending work exists, else terminate(closed, 'Reader closed').
`advanceCommitted(entry, offset)` — the single point where the server-confirmed
committed watermark moves: compacts claimed ranges, lifts `deliveredWatermark`, and
emits `partition.committed{session}` so the observer sees every advance (commit acks,
stop watermarks, commitOffset overrides).

## Reader transport FSM (`reader/transport-state.ts`)

Same five states as the writer transport. The only structural difference: after init,
every other server frame is forwarded verbatim as `transport.stream.message` — the
protobuf → domain classification happens in `reader-runtime.ts` (`classifyServerMessage`),
so the reader FSM never touches `serverMessage.case`.

## Invariants the maps rest on

1. **seqNo is assigned at send time** (writer, auto mode). Buffered messages carry
   `seqNo=0n` and get numbered in `pump`'s `formBatch` — so a reconnect never renumbers,
   and the `closing` pump gate (`hasEverConnected`) guarantees no auto seqNo is ever
   assigned before the server's high-water mark is recovered.
   Pinned by: writer-state tests, `writer-protocol.test.ts` (live dedup proof).
2. **commit() is never rejected by a transparent reconnect** (reader). Pending commits
   are buffered per partition (keyed by `partitionKey` — path + partitionId, so a
   multi-topic reader's equal partition ids never collide) and their exact remaining
   ranges are re-sent after the start handshake on the new session. The only legal
   rejection paths are the `partition_reassign_gc` timer and terminal shutdown.
   Pinned by: `reader.model.test.ts` (800-seed invariant), `reader.multi-topic.test.ts`.
3. **Grant epoch** (`grantId` + `ackPending` / `stopReady`): a partition grant is live
   only after `start_ready` → `start_response`, and a graceful stop is answered only
   after `stop_ready` + drained commits; buffered commits are sent exactly once, and
   stale hook completions (session ids restart at 1 per stream) can never double-answer.
   Pinned by: reader-state tests, `reader.contract.test.ts` start-handshake tests,
   `reader.partition-lifecycle.test.ts`.
4. **Commit ranges are stitched at delivery time** (`deliveredWatermark` +
   per-message `commitRangeStart`): a server-side offset hole (retention, readFrom
   skip) is attributed to the next delivered message, and a delivered-but-unacked
   message is never covered by another message's commit. `claimedRanges` subtracts
   already-sent coverage, so a zero-width, inverted, or overlapping commit range
   (session-fatal server-side) is unrepresentable.
   Pinned by: `reader.commit-semantics.test.ts`, stitching tests in
   `reader-state.test.ts`, model invariant.
5. **Flow control is charged per ReadResponse** and released only when the facade's
   consumer takes the chunk; credit is re-granted in batches of ≥ maxBufferBytes/5.
6. **Terminal errors throw from the facade, never end streams silently**: the output
   queue drains buffered facts first, then throws (`AsyncQueue.fail`), and every later
   `read()`/`commit()`/`close()` rethrows the same reason.

Cross-checks: the model tests (`*.model.test.ts`) wire these exact transition functions
to a protocol-faithful server model and drive them with 800 random seeds per run; the
contract tests exercise the same maps through the public facade over a fake wire.
