// session) — the only demonstrated real-disconnect technique in this repo
// (packages/topic/tests/reconnect.test.ts) relies on discovery-driven pool
// churn over 60+ seconds, which doesn't transfer to a single session stream.
// So this scenario stays on the fake-driver fixture already used by

// (node CRUD, session creation, withSession, openSession's happy path and
// external-signal cancellation) is covered by real-YDB integration tests
