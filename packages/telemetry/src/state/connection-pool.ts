/**
 * Per-driver state of the gRPC connection pool.
 *
 * Two independent maps, deliberately not merged: `#connections` is
 * reconstructed from the `ydb:driver.connection.*` delta events, while
 * `#pools` mirrors the whole-snapshot `ydb:driver.connection.pool.*`
 * channels. Keeping them apart means a pool snapshot cannot materialize a
 * connection-count entry — otherwise a subscriber that attached late (and so
 * missed every `connection.added`) would start exporting a confident
 * `ydb.driver.connection.count{state=live} = 0` for a driver that in fact has
 * N live connections, where before it exported nothing at all.
 *
 * Both are keyed by `DriverIdentity` *reference* (Map identity), so callers
 * must pass the same identity object that the publisher stamps on each payload.
